# BANK OF FLATIRON
This is Bank of Flatiron. An app which shows all your financial data to promote transparency.


## Guide

Youâ€™re going to run a React app that displays a list of your recent bank transactions.


## Setting Up

After unbundling the React project:

 1. Run npm install in your terminal in the directory you are running the app
 2. Run npm run server. This will run your backend on port 8001.

Open http://localhost:8001/transactions in the browser to verify that your backend is working
Add a new terminal then run npm start. This will run your React app.

Note that this app uses 'Semantic UI' for styling which you can install by running 'npm i semantic-ui-react'


## Deliverables

A user should be able to:
    - See a table of all transactions.
    - Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
    - Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.


### Other Deliverables
Bonus deliverables 

A user should be able to:
    - Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
    - Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table

## Conclusion
This app allows a user to view, search, sort their transactions. They even add a new transaction if they have any new ones or delete already viewed transaction.
Building this project with beginner skills in React was obviously very challenging. I needed a lot of help from friends and online tutors to complete this project. Hopefully in the future, with more experience, I can build this without the use of tutors and tutorials seamlessly.
